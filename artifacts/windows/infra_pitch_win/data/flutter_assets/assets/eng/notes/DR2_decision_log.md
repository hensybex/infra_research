# Research Paper 2 Decision Log

## Selection Rationale
1. **Console Copilot as anchor** – Global benchmarks (GitHub Agent HQ, Azure AI Foundry) show developers expect multi-agent orchestration embedded in the console, making it the fastest path to operational lift and differentiation for a lean core team [A2][A3].
2. **Marketplace investment** – AWS Partner Agent Factory demonstrates marketplace-ready agents are becoming the primary go-to-market motion; Selectel’s AI capital plans confirm Russian providers are prioritizing packaged AI ecosystems [A1][A4][A5].
3. **Compliance-first modules** – Russia’s data localization mandate forces every marketplace interaction through verification layers; embedding guardrails early avoids rework and builds trust with sovereign clients [A7].
4. **FinOps & billing insights** – Selectel’s growth and capital intensity make revenue transparency essential; aligning Cost Anomaly Radar and Billing Copilot ensures marketplace monetization stories resonate with finance stakeholders [A4].

## Trade-offs & Alternatives Considered
- **Full managed AI lab vs. marketplace**: Rejected in favor of a leaner marketplace blueprint; operating a laboratory would demand specialist staffing beyond the compact team’s remit.
- **Broad horizontal agent catalogue**: Narrowed to operations, compliance, and marketplace accelerators to align with available capacity and high-value RU differentiators.
- **Early mobile-first push**: Deferred most mobile work to Phase 2 except Voice Ops Companion beta, balancing field value with resource limits.

## Risk Mitigations Embedded
- Progressive automation tiers (read → suggest → execute) guard against console misfires [A2].
- Trust Center + Compliance Evidence Vault create transparent partner governance aligned with localization law [A5][A7].
- Learning Loop Analytics earmarked to prevent backlog drift and reinforce data-driven roadmap iteration [A2].

## Optional Future Branches
- **AI customer success pods**: Wrap Marketplace bundles with managed services once partner traction proves demand.
- **Edge/satellite expansion**: Extend Edge Placement Planner into real-time optimization once telemetry coverage matures [A5].
- **Model hosting consortium**: Collaborate with other RU providers (e.g., Nebius/Yandex) for shared sovereign model registry if regulatory climate allows.

## Outstanding Questions
- Confirm availability of incident/billing telemetry interfaces to scope Phase 0 effort.
- Validate legal stance on cross-border inference for marketplace partners (potential exception handling beyond core residency rules).
- Decide on analytics warehouse (DuckDB vs. Snowflake) based on existing infra to avoid tool sprawl.
