# Macro Landscape – AI Infrastructure & Agent Platforms (Nov 2025)

## Global Trends
- **Agent Factory Models**: AWS GenAIIC Partner Agent Factory accelerates co-built, production-ready AI agents, combining partner domain expertise with AWS methodologies and distributing via AWS Marketplace (artifacts/scrape/20251105T134242Z_aws_partner_agent_factory.md).
- **Developer Agent Ecosystems**: GitHub’s Agent HQ positions the platform as a hub for multi-vendor coding agents (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Cognition, xAI) to plug into developer workflows, highlighting demand for orchestration across toolchains (eng/notes/theverge_github_agent_hq_summary.md).
- **Agent Experience Differentiation**: Azure AI Foundry showcases emotional and productivity agents (e.g., Emotional Support Goose, Penultimate Penguin) to emphasize customization, guardrails, and deployment flexibility spanning local/on-device and cloud (eng/notes/azure_ai_foundry_future_agents_summary.md).

## Russian/CIS Infrastructure Signals
- **Selectel Growth & AI Investment**: Selectel reported RUB 8.9B H1 2025 revenue (+46% YoY) with 5.2B adjusted EBITDA, 30.1K customers, and capex focused on servers/DC expansion (eng/notes/akm_selectel_ifrs_summary.md). TAdviser notes RUB 10B earmarked for AI initiatives and continued bond issuances to fund infrastructure (eng/notes/tadviser_selectel_highlights.md).
- **Regional Market Benchmarks**: Selectel holds ~8.5% share of RU cloud infrastructure and leads bare-metal rental with 56% share (eng/notes/wiki_selectel_summary.md), framing competitive expectations for Timeweb/Selectel peers.
- **Marketplace Momentum**: Local telecoms (e.g., MTS, Rostelecom) exploring marketplaces and AI offerings indicate a broader push for sovereign catalogs leveraging domestic compute; while direct sources remain sparse, demand aligns with sovereign-cloud and data-localization requirements captured by Federal Law 152-ФЗ context.

## Compliance & Residency Context
- Russia’s data localization regime (Federal Law 152-ФЗ) mandates storage of Russian citizens’ personal data on domestic infrastructure, with enforcement authority via Roskomnadzor and escalating penalties (synthesize for later referencing; primary open-source citation pending due to site access constraints).

## Implications for Infra Provider Pitch
- Differentiation lies in orchestrating multi-agent, compliance-aware workflows that can be commercialized via marketplace constructs while servicing internal operations.
- The compact two-person team must leverage the orchestrator stack + MCP to deliver AWS/GitHub-level iteration speed while tuning for RU regulatory and go-to-market realities.
