# Research Paper 2 Solution Pathing – Brief & Strategy

## Objective
Design a solution portfolio and roadmap for a Russian infrastructure provider (TimeWeb/Selectel-like) to justify engaging a compact engineer + product AI team.

## Deliverables
- `eng/reports/DR2_solution_pathing.md`: client-ready narrative covering executive overview, discovery catalog, roadmap, staffing model, risks, appendices.
- `hensybex/projects/infra_pitch/eng/reports/DR2_solution_pathing.md`: final delivery path outside session workspace.
- `eng/notes/DR2_decision_log.md`: reasoning and trade-offs.
- Source mirrors under `sources/DR2/`.
- Maintain `research_log.md` timeline and `inventory.json` metadata.

## Success Criteria
- 20–30 actionable AI/agentic solution concepts tailored to RU infra provider.
- Flagship roadmap highlighting Console Copilot, AI marketplace, support modules with phases (6–12 months), metrics, dependencies, quick wins.
- Clear articulation of the compact team’s unique edge (multi-orchestrator, MCP, vector, mobile/desktop, DevOps automation, compliance aware).
- Integration of global references (AWS Agent Factory, Azure AI Foundry, GitHub Agent HQ) and Russian/CIS context (TimeWeb, Selectel, Rostelecom, VK Cloud, Avito, sovereign cloud programs).
- Risks, assumptions for DR#3 financial validation.
- Compliance/residency considerations noted.

## Constraints & Process
- Time limit: 90 min; max 16 search requests / 20 queries.
- Check-in cadence: every 15 min (log + optional Telegram per SOP).
- Follow deep research SOP: macro scan, hypothesis map, multi-branch investigation, consolidation, final report.

## Strategy
1. Build macro landscape: marketplace models, console copilots, RU infrastructure initiatives, compliance requirements.
2. Identify solution patterns aligned with the two core roles’ capabilities (MCP, multi-orchestrator, vector workflows, mobile surfaces, Dagger automation).
3. Prioritize 20–30 solutions across internal operations, customer-facing marketplace, partner ecosystem.
4. Craft roadmap phases (Foundation, Pilot, Expansion) anchored on Console Copilot & Marketplace, define deliverables, metrics, resource plan.
5. Assess risks, assumptions, optional branches.
6. Document reasoning log, update artifacts, finalize report.
