## Problem & vision
- Japan receives ~36 million tourists per year, yet front-line staff frequently struggle with live translation; Japanese also relies heavily on implied context, making generic LLMs stumble.
- Shisa.ai wants real-time, emotionally aware speech translation so visitors and service workers can converse naturally.

## Product stack
- **Chotto.chat:** mobile/web translator that captures a user’s speech, renders fluent Japanese audio/text, and mirrors tone to keep conversations natural.
- **Wearable integrations:** smartwatch access plus a Telegram bot for on-the-go transcription.
- **Speech recovery & training:** video workouts, AI advisor, and live specialist sessions to help users improve pronunciation or public speaking.

## Proprietary model
- **Shisa V2‑405B:** a 405 B parameter Japanese LLM released under a community license for research/non‑commercial use.
- Benchmarking shows parity with GPT‑4o and DeepSeek‑V3 on instruction following, JP‑EN translation, semantic reasoning, and role-play.
- Model/customization powers Chotto’s real-time translation and contextual understanding.

## Traction & team
- Built by a “nano team” of three people; the model surpassed 1 M Hugging Face downloads within a month.
- Early adopters include travelers, pharmacies, taxis, and other service scenarios; demand also coming from enterprises needing JP‑first copilots.

## Why Japan needs homegrown LLMs
- Cultural nuance (implicit refusals, context-heavy pronouns) requires localized data.
- Economic/security angles: reducing dependency on foreign AI stacks and ensuring sovereign control over language tech.
