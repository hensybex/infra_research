## What Meta announced
- 2025 capital spending is set to jump to **$70–$72 B**, nearly double 2024 levels, to fund AI data centers, networking, and custom silicon.
- Q3 2025 revenue hit **$51.24 B** with **3.54 B** daily active users across Meta’s apps.
- Despite growth, shares fell >8% as investors questioned near-term ROI.

## Broader capex arms race
- Google lifted its 2025 capex outlook to **$93 B**; Microsoft disclosed **$34.9 B** spent last quarter alone.
- Combined, Big Tech could pour **$200 B+** into AI infrastructure next year as demand for cloud AI services surges.

## Investor concerns
- Meta’s free cash flow could drop from ~$54 B (2024) to ~**$20 B** in 2025 because the company is reinvesting almost everything into AI.
- Markets want proof that infrastructure spending translates into new revenue streams beyond ads — e.g., enterprise AI services, devices, or subscriptions.

## Product tie-ins
- The capex push coincides with hardware plays like the **$799 Ray-Ban Display** smart glasses (full-color display + AI assistant), signaling Meta’s ambition to control both compute and user interfaces.

## Key takeaway
Meta argues that owning AI infrastructure is essential to stay competitive with OpenAI/Microsoft and Google, but until monetization pathways crystalize, Wall Street is uneasy with the steep burn.
