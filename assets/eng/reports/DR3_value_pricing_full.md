# Value Engine — Full Value, Pricing & ROI Report

## Executive Summary
- Base retainer: **₽36M/year** (four tranches × ₽9M) aligned with Ignite → Foundation → Pilot Scale → Expansion ({{doc:roadmap_draft|Flagship Roadmap Draft}}, {{doc:dr3_value_pricing|DR3 Value, Pricing & ROI Model}}).
- Success fee ties to outcomes: MTTR savings beyond 20%, marketplace margin >₽60M, new partners, zero compliance incidents. Adds **₽8.6M** in expected case, up to **₽20.8M** aggressive ({{doc:dr3_pricing_table|Pricing Table (Summary)}}, DR3_pricing_table.csv).
- Forecasted roadmap value: **₽72.6M (conservative)**, **₽192.6M (expected)**, **₽329.7M (aggressive)** → ROI 6.6× / 17.6× / 30.2×.
- Retainer is 30–40% cheaper than global AI boutiques ($200–350/h) and faster than hiring an internal team (4–6 month lag + tool cost) ({{doc:dr3_value_pricing|DR3 Value, Pricing & ROI Model}}, sources Uptech / Creole Studios / Profguide / Uchis-Online).
- Model reflects real market data: Selectel ₽8.9B H1 2025 revenue (+46%), ₽10B AI CAPEX, localization fines up to ₽20M, downtime ~$100k/h ({{doc:akm_selectel_ifrs_summary|Selectel — IFRS / RAS snapshot}}, {{doc:tadviser_selectel_highlights|Selectel highlights}}).

## Context & Goal
After DR1 (architecture) and DR2 (portfolio), the client wants price/impact rationale. This doc shows: 1) how roadmap value is quantified, 2) why the retainer + success mix was chosen, 3) comparison vs alternatives, 4) embedded risks/assumptions. Based on {{doc:dr3_value_pricing|DR3 Value, Pricing & ROI Model}}, {{doc:dr3_pricing_table|Pricing Table (Summary)}}, {{doc:akm_selectel_ifrs_summary|Selectel — IFRS / RAS snapshot}}, {{doc:tadviser_selectel_highlights|Selectel highlights}}, plus macro_landscape, staffing_model_draft, roadmap_draft. Goal: a finance-ready chapter for procurement and negotiations.

## Key Insights
1. **Retainer + success fee balance risk.** Client pays fixed access to the duo; variable share depends on delivered value.
2. **Roadmap impact is monetized.** Each KPI (MTTR, marketplace GMV, onboarding speed, fines, automation) is converted into cash using benchmarks + client data.
3. **Alternatives cost more.** Global boutiques and internal hiring are significantly pricier when time-to-value is considered.
4. **Success fee motivates both sides.** Faster MTTR reduction / marketplace growth benefits everyone.
5. **Commercial offer is evidence-backed.** DR1 + DR2 prove technical/product readiness; DR3 finishes the business case.

### Value Buckets (Expected Case)
| Bucket | Value (₽M) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MTTR reduction (−40%) | 54.0 | 270 incidents × ₽0.5M downtime each. |
| Marketplace GMV uplift | 96.0 | 20 offers, ₽12M net margin per offer. |
| Compliance savings | 12.0 | Avoided fines + faster audits. |
| Automation / staffing | 30.6 | Less manual toil, fractional staff plan. |
| **Total** | **192.6** | ROI 17.6× vs base retainer + expected success. |

Numbers mirror {{doc:dr3_pricing_table|Pricing Table (Summary)}}; assumptions (incident counts, ARR, fine probability, downtime cost) recorded in {{doc:dr3_value_pricing|DR3 Value, Pricing & ROI Model}}.

### Pricing & Success Fee Structure
| Element | Amount | Linked KPI | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Retainer** | ₽36M/year (4×₽9M) | Roadmap phases | Covers duo, MCP infra, fractional support. |
| **Success fee — MTTR** | 8% of savings >20% | MTTR <96 min | Ensures we push beyond baseline improvements. |
| **Success fee — Marketplace** | 10% of margin >₽60M | Marketplace GMV | Incentivizes joint GTM + partner support. |
| **Success fee — Partners** | ₽0.5M per partner >10/yr (cap ₽2M) | Launchpad throughput | Clear KPI for sales. |
| **Success fee — Compliance** | ₽1M for zero incidents + Trust Center SLA | Evidence Vault quality | Recognizes flawless compliance execution. |

Total success ≈₽8.6M expected (₽44.6M all-in) and up to ₽20.8M aggressive (₽56.8M all-in).

### Alternative Comparison
| Option | Annual Cost | Time-to-value | Risks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Proposed duo** | ₽36M + success (~₽44.6M expected) | 2–4 weeks | Low: stack already running ({{doc:staffing_model_draft|Staffing & Operating Model — draft}}). |
| **Internal hires** | ₽11M salaries + taxes + tooling (~₽15–18M) | 4–6 months | Lost time, need to build orchestrator/tools. |
| **Global boutique** | $200–350/h → ₽150–260M/yr for 2 FTE | 1–2 months | Expensive, T&M incentives, weak RU compliance focus. |
| **Do nothing** | 0 ₽ | — | Lose ₽72–193M value, risk ₽10–20M fines, stalled marketplace. |

### Alignment with Roadmap & Staffing
- **Ignite (₽9M):** data access, read-only Copilot, FinOps mart, policy framework, initial legal work.
- **Foundation (₽9M):** runbook execution, Launchpad MVP, Compliance Guardrail alpha.
- **Pilot Scale (₽9M):** change automation, Sandbox, Billing Copilot, Trust Center beta.
- **Expansion (₽9M):** Security Playbook Agent, Industry Bundles, Evidence Vault GA.

Fractional designers/legal support baked in ({{doc:staffing_model_draft|Staffing & Operating Model — draft}}) so no surprise invoices.

### Negotiation Arguments
1. **Value share:** client retains >70% of expected value (₽192.6M vs ₽44.6M spend).
2. **Speed:** duo is already ramped; 2–4 weeks vs 4–6 months hiring.
3. **Proof:** DR1 + DR2 show architecture + portfolio readiness; DR2.5 covers compliance.
4. **Transparency:** success fee formulas are deterministic and tied to audited data.
5. **Scalability:** retainer can be revisited annually as marketplace monetization grows.

## Final Recommendations for Vekus
1. **Run a baseline workshop.** Capture MTTR, ARR, partner pipeline, and penalty exposure as the “zero point” for the ROI model.
2. **Lock the success-fee mechanics in legal documents.** Define formulas, measurement cadence, and data sources (telemetry, financial reporting) so procurement can approve quickly.
3. **Tie each payment tranche to roadmap phases.** Aligning Ignite → Expansion with finance milestones simplifies budgeting and executive reporting.
4. **Arm procurement with comparison arguments.** Use the alternative-cost table and global rate references to justify the duo vs internal hiring/boutiques.
5. **Track realized impact quarterly.** Turn on Learning Loop Analytics and Billing Copilot exports so ROI recalculates automatically from live data.

## Risks & Assumptions
- MTTR baseline and incident volume derived from client telemetry.
- Marketplace GMV assumes 20 offers with conservative attach rate.
- Compliance savings assume current fine exposure (₽10–20M) and Roskomnadzor audit cadence.
- Currency/Capex volatility monitored quarterly.
