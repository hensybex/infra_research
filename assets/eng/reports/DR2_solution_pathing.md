# Launch Blueprint — Solution Pathing & Portfolio Blueprint

## 1. Executive Overview
- **Why now**: Russian infrastructure players are racing to prove sovereign AI capabilities while maintaining residency and compliance obligations; Selectel’s 46% YoY revenue growth and planned RUB 10B AI investment underscore the market urgency [A4][A5].
- **North Star**: Position the infra provider as the operational nerve-center for AI workloads by combining a Console Copilot, a sovereign AI marketplace, and compliance-first support modules.
- **Differentiator**: Our engineer + product duo brings hands-on multi-orchestrator experience (MCP, Dagger, vector knowledge bases) inspired by global agent factories and developer ecosystems established by AWS and GitHub [A1][A2].
- **12-month ambition**: Deliver a lean yet scalable program that reduces MTTR by 40%, launches 20+ curated marketplace offers, and creates a transparent compliance posture that accelerates partner trust [A1][A4][A7].

## 2. Discovery Catalog (30 Concepts)
The full catalog (target user, value, stack, effort, benefit to Vekus, references) lives in {{doc:discovery_catalog_table_referenced|discovery_catalog_table_referenced.md}}. At a glance the solutions fall into four clusters:
- **Operations Nerve Center.** Console Copilot Core, Incident War Room Summaries, Observability Storyboard, and Security Playbook Agent drive MTTR reduction through MCP-powered runbooks and telemetry storytelling.
- **Marketplace Growth.** Marketplace Launchpad, Partner Sandbox Orchestrator, Marketplace Quality Scoring, Industry Catalyst Bundles, and Edge Placement Planner create a sovereign offer funnel and transparent Trust Center scorecards.
- **Compliance & Trust.** Compliance Guardrail Advisor, Sovereign Data Toolkit, Compliance Evidence Vault, and Resident Program Tracker embed 152-FZ controls into Launchpad/Sandbox and keep immutable audit logs.
- **Ecosystem & Intelligence.** Cost Anomaly Radar, Billing Intelligence Copilot, Learning Loop Analytics, AI Adoption Navigator, and Community Knowledge Graph link finance, GTM, and product signals for better decisions.

The catalog doubles as a prioritization matrix: it clarifies which APIs (monitoring, billing, CRM), policies, and partner processes must be opened in each roadmap phase so Vekus captures measurable impact.

## 3. Flagship Roadmap (6–12 Month Path)
### Phase 0 – Ignite (Weeks 0–4)
- Stand up baseline telemetry and billing data marts to support automation and FinOps use cases [A4].
- Deliver read-only Console Copilot status digest to prove value quickly [A2].
- Draft marketplace policy framework aligned with data localization mandates [A7].

### Phase 1 – Foundation (Months 1–3)
- Enable runbook execution within Console Copilot and launch Incident War Room summaries [A2].
- Release Marketplace Launchpad MVP plus first three AI Solution Blueprints [A1][A3].
- Ship Compliance Guardrail Advisor alpha and Cost Anomaly Radar dashboards for internal teams [A4][A7].
- **Key metrics**: ≥70% incidents summarized by Copilot; three partner offers onboarded; compliance checklist 80% complete.

### Phase 2 – Pilot Scale (Months 3–6)
- Add controlled automation (approvals, change execution) and Voice Ops Companion beta to Console Copilot [A2][A3].
- Launch Partner Sandbox Orchestrator, Marketplace Quality Scoring, and Trust Center transparency hub [A1][A5].
- Deploy Billing Intelligence Copilot and Resident Program Tracker to support monetization and partner success [A4].
- **Metrics**: 50% maintenance tasks automated; partner NPS ≥8; billing forecast accuracy within ±5%.

### Phase 3 – Expansion (Months 6–12)
- Integrate Security Playbook Agent and Observability Storyboard for proactive resilience [A3][A5].
- Release Industry Catalyst Bundles and Edge Placement Planner to drive marketplace revenue [A1][A5].
- Establish Compliance Evidence Vault and Learning Loop Analytics for continuous improvement [A2][A7].
- **Metrics**: MTTR ↓40%; 20+ marketplace offers live; audit evidence produced <5 days.

### Cross-Cutting Dependencies & Quick Wins
- Prioritize data pipelines early to fuel all AI agents.
- Apply progressive automation (read → suggest → execute) to manage operational risk.
- Repackage blueprint content as partner-facing collateral for immediate marketing lift.

## 4. Staffing & Operating Model Fit
- **Core roles**: Product/strategy lead (hensybex) handles discovery, GTM, compliance narrative; engineer/architect delivers MCP/Dagger integrations and automation.
- **Cadence**: Weekly roadmap syncs, daily async standups, monthly executive demos tied to the roadmap metrics [A2].
- **Capacity split**: 40% Console Copilot, 35% Marketplace, 15% support modules, 10% metrics/documentation.
- **Extended pod**: Fractional designer (Phase 1–2) and part-time legal advisor to vet marketplace offers; leverage partner success managers for validation cycles [A5][A7].
- **Tooling**: MCP orchestrator, Dagger CI, vector DB for knowledge bases, DuckDB/Snowflake for analytics, GitHub Agent HQ workflows to enable multi-agent development [A2].

## 5. Risks & Mitigations
- **Automation misfire**: Poorly governed runbooks could trigger outages → enforce approval gates, canary execution, and rollback scripts in Console Copilot [A2].
- **Compliance breach**: Partner offers may violate residency rules → bake automated checks + manual review gates through Compliance Guardrail Advisor and Trust Center [A7].
- **Bandwidth limits**: Two-person core risks overload → invest early in MCP Pipeline Studio and Learning Loop Analytics to amplify capacity [A2].
- **Partner inertia**: Ecosystem may hesitate to join a new marketplace → showcase Selectel-scale investment signals and transparent Trust Center evidence to build credibility [A4][A5].
