# Infra Pitch Package — work plan

## Target deliverables for Vekus
- **Pitch Deck / Overview (PDF/Markdown).** Concise storyline showing how the multi-orchestrator stack relieves Vekus’ pain points and why it matters now.
- **Solution Playbook.** Roadmap with AI product bundles (console copilot, marketplace, resident program) mapped to Ignite → Expansion phases.
- **Technical Skinny.** Architecture diagrams that detail the orchestrator core, MCP/LLM infrastructure, mobile/vector layers, and guardrail channels.
- **Product Catalogue.** At least 20 catalog entries with target roles, value statements, and required components for the future marketplace.
- **Financial & ROI Doc.** Comparison of the ₽15M retainer model versus alternatives, with key metrics and risk notes.
- **Appendix.** Portfolio snapshots, bios, operating process descriptions, and DR1 evidence extracts.

## Delivery sequence
1. **DR1 — Architecture Validation.** Collect global proof points, confirm compliance with Russian constraints, and finalize the architecture narrative.
2. **DR2 — Solution Pathing.** Build the solution catalog and phased program, highlighting quick wins and flagship streams; publish RU/ENG packages (`assets/rus/reports/DR2_solution_pathing.ru.md`, `assets/eng/reports/DR2_solution_pathing.md`).
3. **DR3 — Value & Pricing.** Construct the cost/ROI model on top of DR2, define retainer + success fee, and release RU/ENG reports (`assets/rus/reports/DR3_value_pricing.ru.md`, `assets/eng/reports/DR3_value_pricing.md`).
4. **Packaging.** Assemble the master pack (deck + playbook + tech + finance) and short formats (one-pager, executive email).
5. **Review.** Final messaging pass, update `graph-index.md`, and link the materials to the case showcase.

## Notes & dependencies
- Store all primary sources inside `sources/`; working notes live in `rus/notes/` and `eng/notes/`.
- Keep the DR1 → DR2 → DR3 chain within ≤10 working days to meet the landing-page deadline.
