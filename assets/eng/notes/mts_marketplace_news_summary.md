# MTS Marketplace Launch (November 2025)

> **Scrape context:** MTS press release announcing its digital solutions marketplace for SMBs; used to benchmark local marketplace UX expectations.

## Offering
- **Scope:** 100+ ecosystem services spanning geoservices, cybersecurity, connectivity, cloud, AI/Big Data, collaboration, and IoT.
- **Format:** Full “one-stop” web experience with catalog, filters by industry/needs/company size, and short descriptions to speed selection.
- **Commerce:** Customers can pay instantly or park offers in a cart, add upsell options, and finalize purchases online with only INN + OGRN details.

## Experience & AI Layer
- Promises personalized recommendations, industry-specific bundles, and a virtual assistant to guide entrepreneurs.
- Emphasizes safety/reliability of transactions plus rapid provisioning for Russian software/hardware (e.g., Mobile Employees, MTS Link, cloud video analytics).
- Ties into broader MTS campaigns (Telegram AI bot launches, “Discount for your own” promos) to drive adoption.

## Implications for Infra Pitch
- Confirms SMB buyers expect consumer-grade checkout and recommendation flows even for complex AI/IoT products.
- Reinforces need for our marketplace launchpad + trust center to match or exceed MTS quality.
- Highlights opportunity to differentiate with compliance-first onboarding, something telecom marketplaces rarely showcase.
