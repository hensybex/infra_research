## Finances & Marketing
- 2024 revenue hit ~13 B₽ (+30% YoY), following 10.2 B₽ in 2023 (+26%). Management says results track the 28–30% growth plan.
- Promotion budget in 2024 totaled 355 M₽ (2.7% of revenue) across advertising and conferences; Cloud.ru spends just 0.7% of revenue, highlighting Selectel’s aggressive GTM push.
- Three-year bond program funds expansion: 2021 issue (3 B₽ @ 8.5%) fully repaid in Feb 2024; 2022 and 2023 issues added two more 3 B₽ tranches (11.5% and 13.3%). 2025 plans raise the placement volume to 6 B₽.

## Investments & AI Focus
- CapEx in 2024 more than doubled versus 2023’s 2.5 B₽ baseline, split between server refresh and new DC builds.
- 2025 agenda earmarks 10 B₽ for AI initiatives and showcases progress during Selectel Tech Day.

## Corporate Moves
- 2024: converted to JSC status, received accreditation from the .RU/.РФ domain coordination center, bought 100% of Unified Network (Servers.ru, Exepto.ru, Fozzy.ru), refreshed board with ex-MegaFon CEO Gevork Vermishyan.
- 2025: investor “Solar wind” increased its stake to 34%, and Selectel featured at TAdviser Custom Software Development 2025.
- 2023: ranked #3 IaaS / #7 PaaS in TAdviser ratings; Tier 5 acquired a 25% stake; continued PCI DSS extensions, Uzbekistan/region build-outs, and IPO preparation.

## Implications for Infra Pitch
- Bond-funded growth plus large promo budgets indicate stakeholders expect bold AI marketplace launches—our proposal must match that ambition.
- Frequent conferences/Tech Day events create opportunities for us to supply agent demos and Console Copilot showcases.
- Governance churn and acquisitions mean executive sponsors will scrutinize ROI; align DR3 value model references when citing these stats.
