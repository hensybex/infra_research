# Research Paper 4 Value & Pricing Cheat Sheet

## Offer Structure
- **Base retainer:** 36 M₽ per year (≈$0.44 M) split into four 9 M₽ tranches that map to Ignite → Foundation → Pilot Scale → Expansion.
- **Success fees:** Expected +8.6 M₽ (up to 20.8 M₽ aggressive) tied to (a) MTTR savings above 20 %, (b) marketplace margin above 60 M₽, (c) partner velocity above 10/year, and (d) zero-reportable compliance incidents.
- **Benchmark delta:** Retainer undercuts global boutiques ($200–$350/hr = $0.7–1.5 M/yr) and arrives faster than hiring an internal squad (4–6 months + automation tooling).

## Value Model Highlights
- **Quantified upside:** 72.6 M₽ (conservative), 192.6 M₽ (expected), 329.7 M₽ (aggressive) across downtime, marketplace revenue, onboarding throughput, compliance, and automation offsets.
- **ROI:** 6.6× → 30× value/cost range with 17.6× in the expected case.
- **Key assumptions:** 12 P1 incidents/year @ 120 min MTTR, 6 B₽ infra ARR, 10 partner deals worth 8 M₽ net each, 15 %→5 % compliance risk reduction, automation reclaiming 0.4 FTE.

## Proof Points
- **Talent economics:** Senior ML = 400 k₽/mo, lead PM = 250–500 k₽/mo + ~30 % payroll taxes; duo retainer keeps total cost predictable.
- **Peer context:** Selectel IFRS 8.9 B₽ (H1 2025) with AI/Ml investments ≈10 B₽; data localization fines now 10–20 M₽+ for sensitive breaches.
- **Artifacts:** Scenario outputs (`eng/notes/DR3_value_model_results.md`) and pricing math (`eng/notes/DR3_pricing_table.csv`) back every number.

Use this note when referencing DR3 in other docs so both languages link to the same canonical pricing facts.
