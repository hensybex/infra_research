# Infra Pitch — Work Schema (2025-11-05)

## Objective
Equip the infra pitch package so the client clearly sees the value of engaging a compact engineer + product team.

## Stream Overview
1. **DR#1 – Architecture Validation** *(complete)*
   - Result: multi-orchestrator stack proof points, compact-team evidence, market signals.
   - Follow-up: run a review session (see `DR1_validation_session_prompt.md`) to extract extra insights for packaging.
2. **DR#2 – Solution Pathing** *(next)*
   - Tasks: (a) scan and shortlist 20–30 feasible AI solutions tailored to the client and the proposed stack; (b) craft one flagship roadmap centered on console assistant + AI marketplace, with supporting projects, phases, dependencies, and quick wins; (c) document reasoning behind the selections.
   - Output: `eng/reports/DR2_solution_pathing.md` plus supporting eng/notes/specs.
3. **DR#3 – Value & Pricing** *(after DR#2)*
   - Tasks: estimate contract size from scratch (no prior 15M RUB bias), model ROI versus alternatives, outline risks/assumptions.
   - Output: `eng/reports/DR3_value_pricing.md` with scenarios.
4. **Packaging & Handoff**
   - Assemble final deck (overview, roadmap, tech diagrams, product catalogue, financials).
   - Prepare short formats (one-pager/email).
   - Sync with Rita’s landing: supply copy per portfolio product, integrate new proof points, attach visuals when ready.
   - Incorporate insights from the DR#1 review session.
