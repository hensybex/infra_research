## What Agent HQ is
- Central hub inside GitHub that orchestrates coding agents from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and others.
- Ships with mission control spanning GitHub.com, VS Code, CLI, and mobile so teams can direct AI tasks, monitor usage, and enforce policy.

## Enterprise-grade features cited
- **Governance plane:** dedicated controls over who can invoke which agent, plus metrics dashboards to quantify AI impact.
- **Agentic code review:** new workflow for AI-led reviews with audit trails.
- **Custom agents:** developers define behavior via config files in VS Code (rules, coding standards, escalation paths) to tailor AI to each repo or team.
- **Integrations:** Slack, Teams, Jira, Azure Boards, etc., pull Agent HQ into existing collaboration loops.

## Why GitHub is doing this
- Enterprises already juggle multiple agent vendors; Agent HQ offers a unifying layer so devs stay inside GitHub tooling rather than hopping between standalone apps.
- IDC notes developers spend only ~16% of their time writing net-new code—agentic automation is seen as the lever to reclaim the rest.

## Analyst take
- IDC’s Sharath Srinivasamurthy says Agent HQ can act as a “single source” for agentic coding platforms, easing governance and reducing context switching.
