## Headline numbers
- Proposed 2026 budget: **₩728 trillion ($506 B)**, the largest in the nation’s history.
- AI allocation: **₩10.1 trillion ($6.9 B)** — more than triple 2025 funding — aimed at compute infrastructure, manufacturing capacity, and industry-specific applications (semiconductors, autos, shipbuilding, robotics).
- Defense request: **₩66.3 trillion ($46 B)**, an 8.2% YoY increase to modernize weapons and lessen reliance on the US.

## Strategic framing
- Lee called the moment a “national survival” inflection as global trade, APEC diplomacy, and the “transformative wave of AI” reshape competition.
- He likened the plan to building a “highway for the AI era,” referencing earlier infrastructure drives under Presidents Park Chung-hee and Kim Dae-jung.

## Nvidia GPU supply deal
- Following APEC talks with Jensen Huang, Nvidia agreed to supply **260,000 GPUs** for Korean AI infrastructure: 50k each to the government, Samsung, SK, Hyundai, plus 60k to Naver.
- Delivery timing depends on Korea standing up new data centers and power capacity; US political rhetoric (Trump’s “US customers first” remark) adds uncertainty.

## Politics & diplomacy
- Conservative lawmakers largely boycotted the speech amid clashes over a probe into ex-President Yoon’s martial-law attempt.
- Lee highlighted lower tariffs on cars/chips after a bilateral with US President Donald Trump during APEC, pitching the budget as a follow-on to that diplomacy.
- US and Korean defense chiefs met in Seoul the same week to discuss cost sharing and operational control transfer.
