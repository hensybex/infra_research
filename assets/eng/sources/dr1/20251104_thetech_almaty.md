## Founder story
- Ukili Omarova watched her grandfather lose speech after a stroke, later building Soile AI during an inclusive-tech hackathon to address similar barriers.
- She’s still in secondary school; the four-person team consists entirely of girls handling engineering, medical, and marketing tracks.

## Product & features
- **Telegram bot + web platform:** recognizes impaired speech, returns clear-text transcripts plus synthesized “clean speech.”
- **Speech recovery suite:** video workouts (long-form + stories), live consultations with speech therapists/psychologists, and an AI advisor available 24/7.
- **Wearable integration:** smartwatch support for quick capture.
- **Extended use cases:** accent training, public-speaking prep, and B2B bundles for clinics, SEN schools, and speaking academies.

## Traction
- Won Kazakhstan’s IT-FEST 2024 inclusive-tech hackathon and a CIS social-startup competition.
- Pilots running with 14 private medical centers and a public-speaking school; BI Group and other corporates have expressed interest.
- International attention from Kyrgyzstan, China, Korea, Russia, USA, Uzbekistan, Japan; invited to global AI forums.

## Go-to-market focus
- B2C: individuals with speech impairments plus learners seeking accent coaching.
- B2B/B2G: clinics, special-ed schools, public institutions; building voice datasets via summer pilots.
- Funding mix: early investors plus a focus on grants instead of equity-heavy rounds.

## Plans
- Expand to neighboring markets (Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan) within a year and continue scaling the multilingual speech dataset.
