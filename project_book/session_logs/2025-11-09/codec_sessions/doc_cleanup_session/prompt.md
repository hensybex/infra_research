Clean the note Markdown files flagged as dirty in project_book/session_logs/2025-11-09/app_content_qc/WORKING_SCHEMA.md and scrapping-results-clearing.md. Treat each note as messy: remove scrape junk, placeholders, and social widgets, then add a short “Scrape context” block when the source is harvested data. Preserve keeper links without leading blank lines and keep the meaningful scrape content intact once polished. Record every file you touch and the decisions you make in logs.md within this session directory.
